Real-time lip synchronization based on your microphone input, 
making sure your avatar's mouth movements match your speech.

LipSync does not rely on MediaPipe but it can enhance existing MediaPipe 
tracking for accurate mouth movement and maintains mouth movement even 
when the camera is blocked or obscured.
